    <p>I'm a twenty-something, coffee addicted, self-taught Software Developer based in NYC.</p>  
<p>My coding journey began in 2008 when I designed my first Tumblr theme, blending creativity with code. Over the years, I’ve expanded my skills beyond frontend design, focusing more on backend development to build scalable, efficient systems that power user-friendly experiences.</p>  
<p>These days, I’m honing my backend expertise while continuing to create software that solves real real-world problems.</p>
<p>In my free time, I enjoy fitness and trying out new restaurants. </p>
